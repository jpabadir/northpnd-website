TODOs:
- Add floating labels to my form
- Use react reveal
- Test on iPad pro portrait mode (especially the contact form)
- Services component: make the total width of the cards smaller when on mobile,
currently it's too wide.
- Add functionality so that all cards flip back to normal when you click anywhere on the website
- Out work thing should keep 3 columns for longer when shrinking.
- Make FormSpree redirect to us (but with empty fields)
- Fix scrolling stalling

- Make a script that builds, moves the build folder into the server side one, and pushes to git. Maybe I need to 
do that in the CI pipeline when I make a PR into master instead of pushing to master all the time.

DONE: 
- The YouTube video needs to have a different height. - DONE
