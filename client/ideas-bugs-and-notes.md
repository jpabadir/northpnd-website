BUGS:

Improvements:

- useLayoutEffect is used badly!
- Services component: make the total width of the cards smaller when on mobile,
  currently it's too wide.
- Clear fields when opening contact form so that after filling out formspree, you have a clear fields.
- Make FormSpree redirect to us (but with empty fields)
- Maybe we want to reduce the font size on small devices?
- Center About and Contact on screens above 1200px in width?
- Make sure padding at top of all elements looks good on iPhone 5/SE
- Make Habit One mockup perspective mockup
- Change API key since it was pushed to github
- Add some pricing
- Write some articles
- Fix padding on small screen (sides are a bit small)

- Clear issues from the console

NICE TO HAVES:

- Add floating labels to my form
- Fix SVG on second monitor

MAYBEs:

- Add call to action higher up

MISCELLANEOUS:

- A cool grey I can use: #EEEEEE

DONE:

- The YouTube video needs to have a different height.
- Put minheight 100 vh on components
- Make a script that builds, moves the build folder into the server side one, and pushes to git. Maybe I need to
  do that in the CI pipeline when I make a PR into master instead of pushing to master all the time.
- Test on iPad pro portrait mode (especially the contact form)
- Fix scrolling stalling
- Center the title on the Habit One component
- On the About component, the content should be at half the screen's height
- Make proper YouTube video to embed
- Add down arrow to show you can scroll
- Make the Contact padding the same as the About
- Make tell me more more down on higher height screens (test on iiyama monitor, it looks too high)
- Add shadow to all interactable elements
- Fix max-width of Home title (test on iiyama)
- Our work thing should keep 3 columns for longer when shrinking. Actually, maybe we should just make it the same size as the services cards. Also, they're a bit large.
- Make sure it looks good on iPhone 6/7/8
- Resizing works when dragging the chrome inspector handle, but not when resizing the browser itself.
- Work on copy
- Add website footer
- Fix dns and stuff
- Fix naked domain SSL issue (or I think it's actually non-naked)
- For the services cards, we could add little videos with text underneath instead of what we currently have.
- Add navbar animation
- Fix homescreen sentence
- Use react reveal
- Add some SVG curves in between components
- Fix mobile menu labels that are still there when you close the toggle
- Fix toggle bar blur
- Re-enable spy to true for heights that allow it
