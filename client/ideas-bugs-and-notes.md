TODOs:

- Add floating labels to my form
- Use react reveal
- Services component: make the total width of the cards smaller when on mobile,
  currently it's too wide.
- Add functionality so that all cards flip back to normal when you click anywhere on the website
- Our work thing should keep 3 columns for longer when shrinking. Actually, maybe we should just make it the same size as the services cards.
- Make FormSpree redirect to us (but with empty fields)
- Make proper YouTube video to embed
- Add call to action higher up?
- Add down arrow to show you can scroll
- Make the Contact padding the same as the About
- Add shadow to all interactable elements
- Maybe we want to reduce the font size on small devices?

DONE:

- The YouTube video needs to have a different height. - DONE
- Put minheight 100 vh on components - DONE
- Make a script that builds, moves the build folder into the server side one, and pushes to git. Maybe I need to
  do that in the CI pipeline when I make a PR into master instead of pushing to master all the time. - DONE
- Test on iPad pro portrait mode (especially the contact form) - DONE
- Fix scrolling stalling - DONE
- Center the title on the Habit One component - DONE
- On the About component, the content should be at half the screen's height - DONE
