A. First, read what you've already been given (links or Discord messages), B. and then try with other resources from the internet too. Step 2.

Step 1: In general, what you want to do as a software developer before you ask for help is give yourself some time to try and figure it out on your own. This includes googling new resources, but it especially includes looking carefully at anything already sent to you by the person who's helping you. \"Hey JP, I'm trying to make /Home my default page. I read through the guide you sent me and was trying to follow it, but I don't understand step 3 and I can't get unstuck. Can you help me?\" And now, I'm thinking \"Okay, I sent him a resource, he read it and tried his best to follow it, and he's stuck, so let me help him\". Always read through what you've been sent before asking for help, because the answer to your question might be in there (which is the case here). Obviously, if I send you a very long web page or YouTube video, I don't expect you to watch the whole thing before asking for help, you have to use common sense to decide what's reasonable, but you always have to ask questions in a way where the person you ask for help from feels like you exhausted the help they already sent you (whether that's a guide they sent or prior instructions or anything)."]})}},818:function(e,t,i){"use strict";i.r(t),i.d(t,{default:function(){return o}});i(6080);var s=i(184);function o(){return(0,s.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"When you ask others to review your code, you should have first made sure that it's as good as you can possibly make it on your own."}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"Therefore, to ensure that your PR is of the highest quality, you have to follow the following four steps every time you submit a PR:"}),(0,s.jsxs)("ol",{children:[(0,s.jsx)("li",{children:"Complete the task (build the feature or fix the bug.)"}),(0,s.jsxs)("li",{children:["QA extensively.",(0,s.jsx)("ul",{children:(0,s.jsx)("li",{children:"QAing (quality assurance-ing) means you're manually testing your code to make sure your feature works, handles edge cases gracefully, and does not introduce new bugs to the existing codebase.
