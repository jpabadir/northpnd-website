        Before you can start working on GitHub, you need a GitHub account to allow you to access the repositories you wish to edit.
        Creating a GitHub account is not a difficult task however, and you can do so just by going to the <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank"> GitHub Website</a> and clicking "Sign Up".
        If you are experiencing troubles, you can take a look at this quick, more in depth tutorial <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-github-account?view=vs-2022" target="_blank"> here</a>.

        The next step towards working with GitHub is downloading Git, which is a control system that is usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively.
        To download git, go to their website <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">here</a> and download the latest source release for your system. 
        For more set up instructions, visit google or <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git" target="_blank">this website</a> if needed.
