      <h2>Asking for help</h2>
      <p>
        As a software engineer, asking for help is crucial. It's very important to do so. You do not want you to be stuck for hours without asking for help, so it's expected that you'll be asking plenty of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
      When you do, you have to follow the two steps below.
      {/* When you do, you have to write it in a way where the person you're asking for help from feels like you already read the resources they sent you and that you tried to follow any prior guidance they gave you. For instance:  */}
      </p>
      Step 1. 
        A. First, read what you've already been given (links or Discord messages), 
        B. and then try with other resources from the internet too. 

        Step 2. 
        Explain that you've done step 1, and where step 1 has led you, where in that step you got stuck. 
      Step 1: 
       In general, what you want to do as a software developer before you ask for help is give yourself some time to try and figure it out on your own. This includes googling new resources, but it especially includes looking carefully at anything already sent to you by the person who's helping you. 

 

 "Hey JP, I'm trying to make /Home my default page. I read through the guide you sent me and was trying to follow it, but I don't understand step 3 and I can't get unstuck. Can you help me?" 

 And now, I'm thinking "Okay, I sent him a resource, he read it and tried his best to follow it, and he's stuck, so let me help him". Always read through what you've been sent before asking for help, because the answer to your question might be in there (which is the case here). 

 Obviously, if I send you a very long web page or YouTube video, I don't expect you to watch the whole thing before asking for help, you have to use common sense to decide what's reasonable, but you always have to ask questions in a way where the person you ask for help from feels like you exhausted the help they already sent you (whether that's a guide they sent or prior instructions or anything).
