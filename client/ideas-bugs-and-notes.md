TODOs:

- Services component: make the total width of the cards smaller when on mobile,
  currently it's too wide.
- Add functionality so that all cards flip back to normal when you click anywhere on the website
- Our work thing should keep 3 columns for longer when shrinking. Actually, maybe we should just make it the same size as the services cards. Also, they're a bit large. 
- Make FormSpree redirect to us (but with empty fields)

- Maybe we want to reduce the font size on small devices?
- Center About and Contact on screens above 1200px in width?
- Add website footer
- Work on copy
- Add navbar animation
- Make sure it looks good on iPhone 6/7/8

DONE:
