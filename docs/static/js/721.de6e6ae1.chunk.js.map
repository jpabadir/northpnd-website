others, an organized platform where everyone can collaborate together is key, and that's exactly what GitHub can provide.\n        For people who has never used or seen GitHub before, phrases like \"pushing\" or \"pulling\" may seem alien and unfamiliar, but after reading this article, they'll just be another everyday hassle.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Before getting to all that however, first, there are some things you must do before you can start your work on GitHub:\n      </p>\n      <header>\n        <h2>Creating a GitHub Account</h2>\n      </header>\n      <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/GitHub.png\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      <p>\n        Before you can start working on GitHub, you need a GitHub account to allow you to access the repositories you wish to edit.\n        Creating a GitHub account is not a difficult task however, and you can do so just by going to the <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GitHub Website</a> and clicking \"Sign Up\".\n        If you are experiencing troubles, you can take a look at this quick, more in depth tutorial <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-create-github-account?view=vs-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> here</a>.\n      </p>\n      <header>\n        <h2>Downloading Git</h2>\n      </header>\n      <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/git-logo.png\" height=\"250\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      <p>\n        The next step towards working with GitHub is downloading Git, which is a control system that is usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively.\n        To download git, go to their website <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and download the latest source release for your system.\n        For more set up instructions, visit google or <a href=\"https://github.com/git-guides/install-git\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this website</a> if needed.\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/Downloading_Git.jpg\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      </p>\n      <header>\n        <h2>VSCode</h2>\n      </header>\n      <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/VSCode.jpg\" height=\"250\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      <header>\n        <h3>Downloading VSCode</h3>\n      </header>\n      <p>\n        Now all we need is a coding IDE to get started.\n        VSCode is the recommanded IDE to use, as it is compatible with all kinds of coding languages, and is quite simple to use.\n        To get started, visit their website <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, and just like before with Git, download the latest version and follow the executable instructions to finish.\n        For further information, a useful guide website is linked <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.\n      </p>\n      <header>\n        <h3>Setting Up VSCode</h3>\n      </header>\n      <p>\n        Now that we have VSCode downloaded and opened, all that is left to do is set it up to be ready to work with GitHub.\n        The simplest way to get started pushing and pulling between VSCode and GitHub is by installing the extension \"GitHub Pull Requests and Issues\".\n        You can find this by searching for the extension in the Extensions Marketplace in VSCode.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/Extensions1.jpg\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\"></img>\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/Extensions2.jpg\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\"></img>\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/Extensions3.jpg\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      </p>\n      <header>\n        <h2>Cloning the Repository</h2>\n      </header>\n      <p>\n        Once the extension is downloaded, we can finally start working on some code.\n        The first step towards that is going to be getting access to that code in the first place.\n        To do this, we do something called a <code>Git: Clone</code>.\n        First, we need the link to the code that you want to edit and clone.\n        To get this, go to the repository in GitHub, and copy the HTTPS link under the green \"Code\" button.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/Link.jpg\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now going back to VSCode, open the command palette with the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + P or by clicking the option under \"View\".\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/Cloning.jpg\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now run the command <code>Git: Clone</code> and paste in the link that you just copied.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/GitClone.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img src=\"/publicassets/Getting Started With GitHub Images/Paste.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"\"></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now after running the command and pasting the link to the repository,\n        you will be prompted to select a local folder where you want to clone the\n        repository. Once you have selected a folder, the cloning process will begin\n        and you will be able to see the progress in the VSCode terminal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Once the cloning process is complete, you will be able to see the cloned repository\n        in the Explorer pane in VSCode. You can now open any file in the repository and start\n        making changes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Before making any changes, it's always a good idea to create a new branch so that you don't\n        accidentally modify the main branch. You can create a new branch by clicking on the \"Branch\"\n        button in the bottom left corner of the VSCode window and then selecting \"Create New Branch\".\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now you can start making changes to the code and commit them to your branch. Once you are done\n        with the changes, you can push them to the remote repository using the <code>Git: Push command</code>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <img></img>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And that's it! You are now ready to work with GitHub and VSCode. Happy coding!\n      </p>\n      <br></br>\n    </div>\n  );\n}","import \"./BlogStyles.css\";\n\nexport default function Content() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Before I start, first of all, <a href=\"https:nohello.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">please don't just say \"hi\"</a>.</p>\n      <h2>Asking for help</h2>\n      <p>\n        As a software engineer, asking for help is crucial. It's very important to do so. You do not want you to be stuck for hours without asking for help, so it's expected that you'll be asking plenty of questions.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      When you do, you have to follow the two steps below.\n      {/* When you do, you have to write it in a way where the person you're asking for help from feels like you already read the resources they sent you and that you tried to follow any prior guidance they gave you. For instance:  */}\n      </p>\n      Step 1. \n        A. First, read what you've already been given (links or Discord messages), \n        B. and then try with other resources from the internet too. \n\n        Step 2. \n        Explain that you've done step 1, and where step 1 has led you, where in that step you got stuck. \n      Step 1: \n       In general, what you want to do as a software developer before you ask for help is give yourself some time to try and figure it out on your own. This includes googling new resources, but it especially includes looking carefully at anything already sent to you by the person who's helping you. \n\n \n\n \"Hey JP, I'm trying to make /Home my default page. I read through the guide you sent me and was trying to follow it, but I don't understand step 3 and I can't get unstuck. Can you help me?\" \n\n And now, I'm thinking \"Okay, I sent him a resource, he read it and tried his best to follow it, and he's stuck, so let me help him\". Always read through what you've been sent before asking for help, because the answer to your question might be in there (which is the case here). \n\n Obviously, if I send you a very long web page or YouTube video, I don't expect you to watch the whole thing before asking for help, you have to use common sense to decide what's reasonable, but you always have to ask questions in a way where the person you ask for help from feels like you exhausted the help they already sent you (whether that's a guide they sent or prior instructions or anything). \n\n\n\n\n    </div >\n  );\n}\n\n\n","import \"./BlogStyles.css\";\n\nexport default function Content() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>\n        When you ask others to review your code, you should have first made sure that it's as good as you can possibly make it on your own.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Therefore, to ensure that your PR is of the highest quality, you have to follow the following four steps every time you submit a PR:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Complete the task (build the feature or fix the bug.)</li>\n        <li>QA extensively.\n          <ul>\n            <li>QAing (quality assurance-ing) means you're manually testing your code to make sure your feature works, handles edge cases gracefully, and does not introduce new bugs to the existing codebase.

You'll typically run the entire application locally so that you can make changes and view their effect instantly and test them before \"deploying\" to production.</li>\n          <li><i>Staging</i>: this is an \"in-between\" environment. It's different from the local environment in that it's usually accessible by not just you, but a chosen set of users. Usually, this will be a predefined list of people who will be given early access to new features or bug fixes such that they may test it and give feedback on it. For instance, while working with clients, we will often deploy the latest version of the code to a site like <strong>staging.theclientsdomain.com</strong> and ask the client to double check that everything looks good before we deploy the changes to production for everyone to use.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}","import React, { useState, useLayoutEffect } from \"react\";\nimport \"./Article.css\";\nimport { linkify } from \"../../helpers\";\n\nexport default function Article(props) {\n  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    function updateIsMobile() {\n      setIsMobile(document.documentElement.clientWidth < 992);\n    }\n    window.addEventListener('resize', updateIsMobile);\n    updateIsMobile();\n    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', updateIsMobile);\n  }, []);\n\n  const ComponentToRender = require(\"../../blogs/\" +\n    linkify(props.blog.title)).default;\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"StandalonePageParent\">\n      <div className=\"Article\">\n        <div style={{ maxWidth: \"1100px\" }}>\n          <div className=\"text-left mb-4\">\n            <h1>{props.blog.title}</h1>\n            {/* <h4 className=\"Subtitle\">{props.blog.subtitle}</h4> */}\n            <div className=\"Date\">\n              {new Date(props.blog.publishDate).toLocaleDateString(undefined, { weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })}\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"d-flex align-items-center\">\n              <img className=\"ProfilePicture\" src={props.blog.profilePic} style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }} />\n              <div className=\"Author\">{props.blog.author}</div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"d-flex align-items-center flex-column\">\n            <div className=\"ArticleImage\">\n              <img\n                className=\"ArticleImage\"\n                src={props.blog.image}\n                alt={props.blog.title}\n              />\n              <p className=\"ImageCaption\">{props.blog.imageCaption}</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          {props.blog.isStaff &&\n            (<div className={\"d-flex pt-1 mb-4 \" + (isMobile ?
