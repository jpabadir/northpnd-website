TODOs:

- Add floating labels to my form
- Services component: make the total width of the cards smaller when on mobile,
  currently it's too wide.
- Add functionality so that all cards flip back to normal when you click anywhere on the website
- Our work thing should keep 3 columns for longer when shrinking. Actually, maybe we should just make it the same size as the services cards.
- Make FormSpree redirect to us (but with empty fields)
- Add shadow to all interactable elements
- Maybe we want to reduce the font size on small devices?
- Make tell me more more down on higher height screens (test on iiyama monitor, it looks too high)
- Center About and Contact on screens above 1200px in width?

DONE:

- The YouTube video needs to have a different height. - DONE
- Put minheight 100 vh on components - DONE
